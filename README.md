## About Me:
I am currently a Junior at the University of Arizona studying Computer Science. Probably one of the most important things to me in life is to learn the skills to be able to help others and make their lives simpiler and more enjoyable. I originally was super interested in Biology and thinking about becoming a doctor, but thanks to a close friend of mine they convinced me to check out some cs. 

Since then I transistioned to Bioinformatics, and then finally computer science! Programing is such a wide and sometimes overwhelming field, but as my dad always says:

Old dad wisdom aside, feel free to take a look around and see what I've been up to. I'm always open to collaboration and learning opputunities. 

## Skills
Some languages that I am familiar with are: 

- Java **(3 years)**
- Html5 **(1 year)**
- Visual Basic **(1 year)**

I am also interested in learning some more including PHP, Python, and C++. 

Some of my other achivements include being able to help out with causes im passionate about. I was the design chair for the Chinese Student Association, where I spent a lot of time working to help promote Asian culture and awareness. With my other fellow board members we were able to raise **$1145** for orphaned disadvantaged children in china.
