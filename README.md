## About Me:
I am currently a Senior at the University of Arizona studying Computer Science. I chose this path because I want to learn the skills to be able to help others and the world become more connected and digital. I originally was super interested in Biology and thinking about becoming a doctor, but thanks to a close friend of mine they convinced me to check out some cs. 

Since then I transistioned to Bioinformatics, and then finally computer science! It's flexibilty and impact on society are the ideas that drew me in to the subject. The amount of possibilities computer science has to help others really excited me. Programming is such a wide and sometimes overwhelming field, but I think is the future of industry.

Feel free to take a look around and see what I've been up to. I'm always open to collaboration and learning opputunities. 

## Skills
Some languages that I am familiar with are: 

- Java **(4 years)**
- Html5 **(1 year)**
- JavaScript **(2 years)**
- CSS **(1 year)**
- C **(1 year)**

Other mentionable languages are Ruby, Prolog, Scala, and Mips. 

### What is good Programing to me?
I believe good programming is a well thought out and careful process. An idea should be well thought out and implemented in multiple ways, maybe requiring 3 or more drafts. The *first* draft being a rough sketch of an idea, creating a program that **works**, but that might not be clean or efficient. The second and third drafts should be aimed at improving the readability and stability of that initial code. You might compare it to a running car. Sure, you can hook up an air intake, a blockhead, and some pistions and the car *might* run, but optimizing and building in stability is what makes a car great. I want to be able to develop fast to create and demonstrate ideas, and then take those implementations back to the table to strengthen and refine them. 

## Other Interests 

Some of my other interests include being able to help out with causes I'm passionate about. I was the design chair for the Chinese Student Association, where I spent a lot of time working to help promote Asian culture and awareness. Throughout the year we held sold Chinese food, designed and produced T-shirts, and held a charity banquet to raise funds. With my other fellow board members we were able to accumulate **$1145** for orphaned disadvantaged children in china.

I also enjoy visual art and design. I started the film club at my highschool and ever since then I've had a side hobby of editing pictures, photography, and photoshop. I've used photoshop even longer than I've coded so that saying something *(hopefully beneficial)*. I think visual design is an important skill to have as a programmer. Regardless if one is working with top or bottom level code, being able to see something in your head that can't manifest itself is a usefull skill. Looking at a scenery and picking the perfect colors and angle in your head is not so different from looking at a project and thinking of an elegant robust solution.
